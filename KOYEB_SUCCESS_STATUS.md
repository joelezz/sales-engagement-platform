```

#### 3. Set Security Keys (Required)
```bash
# Generate and set secure keys:
SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-key-minimum-32-characters-long
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your-jwt-secret-key-minimum-32-characters-long
```

#### 4. Configure CORS (Optional)
```bash
# If deploying frontend separately:
CORS_ORIGINS=https://your-frontend-domain.com,https://equal-correna-joelezz-d150d717.koyeb.app
